# 🚨 The Emergency Traffic Prioritization System (ETPS)

A smart traffic signal system that detects emergency vehicles using RFID and dynamically alters traffic lights to prioritize their passage. Built with **Raspberry Pi**, **Arduino Nano**, **Python**, **SQLite**, and **Flask**, this system integrates **dual RFID readers**, a **web dashboard**, and **GPIO-based light controls**.

## 🔌 Hardware Connections

### 🔴 Signal 1 (Connected to Raspberry Pi)

| LED Color | GPIO Pin (BOARD) |
|-----------|------------------|
| Red       | 5                |
| Yellow    | 12               |
| Green     | 3                |
| White (Emergency) | 40       |

### 🟡 Signal 2 (Connected to Raspberry Pi)

| LED Color | GPIO Pin (BOARD) |
|-----------|------------------|
| Red       | 13               |
| Yellow    | 38               |
| Green     | 15               |

### 📡 RFID Connections

#### 1. **RFID1** via Arduino Nano (USB)
- Arduino reads RFID and sends UID + name via serial (`/dev/ttyUSB0`)
- Acts as emergency case entry

#### 2. **RFID2** via MFRC522 to Raspberry Pi SPI

| MFRC522 Pin | Raspberry Pi Pin (BOARD) |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| SDA         | 24 (CE1)                 |
| SCK         | 23                       |
| MOSI        | 19                       |
| MISO        | 21                       |
| GND         | 6                        |
| RST         | 22                       |
| 3.3V        | 1                        |

## ⚙️ Software Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shreyas-sridhar/The-Emergency-Traffic-Prioritization-System.git
cd The-Emergency-Traffic-Prioritization-System
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install flask RPi.GPIO spidev sqlite3
```

For MFRC522:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pimylifeup/MFRC522-python.git
cd MFRC522-python
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

### 3. Enable SPI on Raspberry Pi

```bash
sudo raspi-config
# Navigate to: Interface Options > SPI > Enable
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
cd The-Emergency-Traffic-Prioritization-System
python3 app.py
```

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Driver scans RFID card** → RFID UID is read by Arduino and sent to Raspberry Pi via Serial.
2. **Severity is determined** → System uses UID mapping to assign severity (stored in DB).
3. **If severity ≥ 3**, signal turns **white** (emergency priority) and overrides normal cycles.
4. **Web dashboard** displays case info and nearby hospitals.
